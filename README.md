This is a wordle solver that uses a file full of english words and quickly reads through it. Checking for length and the letters in the word. If it makes it through the first round, then it is compared against the letters that should be in the word. Uses postion in the calculation.
Took less than 2 hours to create, and the hardest part was remembering the names of functions in python.
